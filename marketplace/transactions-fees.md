# 🔹Transactions fees

**The Hominids Project's Era-Homi marketplace** is designed to provide users with a seamless and cost-effective experience when buying and selling hominid NFTs. We are proud to offer a competitive transaction fee structure that promotes accessibility and profitability for our user community.&#x20;



Here's a detailed look at our fees, complete with emojis for an engaging presentation:

💸 **Transaction Fee:** The transaction fee on Era-Homi is set at a competitive rate of only 1% per transaction. This fee is applied to buyers when purchasing a hominid NFT on the platform. We are committed to keeping these fees as low as possible to allow our users to maximize their transactions while supporting the continued operation of the platform.

🔒 **Locking Fee:** When a user decides to lock their HOMI NFT to participate in specific activities such as betting games or auctions, a locking **fee of 0% of the item price is charged**. This fee is designed to encourage responsible use of game features and to create a reward pool for participants.

🌍 **Carbon Offset Fee:** Recognizing the environmental impact of blockchain technology, we have implemented carbon offset initiatives. For every transaction made on Era-Homi, a percentage of 2% is taken as a contribution to carbon offset projects. This allows us to minimize our ecological footprint and contribute to environmental sustainability.

✨ **Benefits for eHOMI Token Holders:** We also offer benefits to our eHOMI token holders. Users who own eHOMI tokens can enjoy discounts on transaction fees, exclusive privileges and special rewards. This creates an incentive to hold and use the eHOMI token while reinforcing the value of the Hominids ecosystem.



At **Hominids**, we are committed to maintaining full transparency regarding our transaction fees. Our goal is to create a fair and engaging marketplace experience for users, while ensuring that costs remain competitive and reasonable. We are excited to welcome our growing community to Era-Homi and support them in their hominid NFT exchanges!
