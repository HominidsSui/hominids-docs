# 🔹Transactions fees

**The Hominids Project's Era-Homi marketplace** is designed to provide users with a seamless and cost-effective experience when buying and selling hominid NFTs. We are proud to offer a competitive transaction fee structure that promotes accessibility and profitability for our user community.&#x20;



Here's a detailed look at our fees, complete with emojis for an engaging presentation:

💸 **Transaction Fee:** The transaction fee on Era-Homi is set at a competitive rate of only X% per transaction. This fee is applied to buyers when purchasing a hominid NFT on the platform. We are committed to keeping these fees as low as possible to allow our users to maximize their transactions while supporting the continued operation of the platform.

🔄 **Listing Fee:** For sellers wishing to list their hominid NFTs for sale on Era-Homi, a listing fee of X HOMI tokens is required. This listing fee is essential to ensure the quality and security of our marketplace, as well as to support the ongoing development of new features and improvements.

🔒 **Locking Fee:** When a user decides to lock their HOMI NFT to participate in specific activities such as betting games or auctions, a locking **fee of 0% of the item price is charged**. This fee is designed to encourage responsible use of game features and to create a reward pool for participants.

🌍 **Carbon Offset Fee:** Recognizing the environmental impact of blockchain technology, we have implemented carbon offset initiatives. For every transaction made on Era-Homi, a percentage of X% is taken as a contribution to carbon offset projects. This allows us to minimize our ecological footprint and contribute to environmental sustainability.

✨ **Benefits for HOMI Holders:** We also offer benefits to our HOMI token holders. Users who own HOMI tokens can enjoy discounts on transaction fees, exclusive privileges and special rewards. This creates an incentive to hold and use the HOMI token while reinforcing the value of the Hominids ecosystem.

🚀 **Launching on SUI:** Finally, with our deployment on the SUI blockchain, we are able to offer fast, secure and cost-effective transaction fees. The SUI blockchain offers high scalability and low transaction fees, allowing our users to enjoy a smooth and cost-effective experience when transacting on Era-Homi.



At **Hominids**, we are committed to maintaining full transparency regarding our transaction fees. Our goal is to create a fair and engaging marketplace experience for users, while ensuring that costs remain competitive and reasonable. We are excited to welcome our growing community to Era-Homi and support them in their hominid NFT exchanges!
