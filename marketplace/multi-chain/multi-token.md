# 🔹Multi-Token

The **Era-Homi Marketplace of the Hominids project** is an innovative platform that offers users a complete experience in the world of hominid NFT. One of the key aspects of this platform is the implementation of a Multi-Token system, which brings an additional dimension to the Hominids ecosystem. 🚀



💎 **HOMI Tokens:** The **HOMI Token** is the central pillar of the Era-Homi Marketplace economy. It is a native token of the **SUI blockchain**, which allows users to interact with the platform seamlessly and enjoy various benefits. **HOMI holders can participate in the platform's activities**, pay 0**% transaction fees and commissions**, as well as earn rewards by participating in betting games. 💰



🔥 **Hominid NFT Tokens:** The Era-Homi Marketplace also offers the possibility to issue specific Tokens for each Hominid NFT created on the platform. These Tokens are associated with unique characteristics of each NFT, such as specific physical traits, special skills or special powers. These NFT Tokens can be traded, bought and sold on the platform, providing users with a new dimension of interaction and customization of their NFTs. 🦍



💼 **Tokens from NFT Projects:** the Era-Homi Marketplace Multi-Token also allows third-party NFT projects to create and issue their own Tokens on the platform. This opens up new opportunities for NFT artists and creators to promote and monetize their work. Tokens from NFT Projects can be used for specific features, rewards, exclusive benefits or even to participate in auctions and special events. 🎨





🌈 The combination of these different Tokens creates a dynamic and diverse ecosystem on the Era-Homi Marketplace. Users have the ability to explore a wide range of offerings, interact with unique NFTs and participate in engaging activities, all using the appropriate Tokens. This allows for deep personalization, an immersive experience and increased value for Token holders. 🌍
