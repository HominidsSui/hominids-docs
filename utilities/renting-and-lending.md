# 🔹Renting and Lending

The HOMINIDS project is excited to introduce an exciting feature: Renting and Lending exclusive NFTs. This unique feature offers HOMINIDS NFT holders the ability to customize their artistic creations by changing the specific traits of their NFTs. 🎨✨





🔁 **Renting NFTs:** HOMINIDS NFT owners now have the ability to rent their NFTs to other interested users. As an owner, you can set the rental price and the length of the rental period according to your preferences. The longer the rental period, the higher the price can be. This allows you to generate additional income by temporarily sharing your NFT with other enthusiasts. 💰💼



💫 **Lending NFTs:** Lending HOMINIDS NFTs provides a unique opportunity for NFT owners to share the benefits and use of their creations with other users. By lending your NFT, you allow a borrower temporary access to your NFT, allowing them to explore its unique features and functionality. You can define the terms of the loan, such as duration and potential rewards for the borrower. This is a great opportunity to create social interactions and show off your exclusive NFT to a wider community. 👥🌍
