**HOMINIDS** is a revolutionary project in the field of blockchain and decentralized finance. Our vision is to create an innovative and accessible mobile metaverse ecosystem, offering an immersive experience and economic opportunities for users.

\
Our **mission** is to create an _innovative mobile universe_ that combines blockchain technology, NFT features and immersive experiences to provide a social and fun platform for our users. We aim to revolutionize the way users interact with metavers by offering a unique mobile experience.

\
Our **vision** is to become the _leading mobile metaverse_, offering a comprehensive and immersive platform where users can explore, create, interact and trade using unique digital assets. We aim to create a dynamic virtual environment where creativity, innovation and community thrive.HOMINIDS tackles several problems present in the field of blockchain and decentralized finance:



* **Limited accessibility:** existing metavers and NFT platforms are often focused on desktop users, leaving mobile users excluded. HOMINIDS solves this problem by offering a metavers experience optimized for mobile devices, enabling a wider range of users to participate in the blockchain ecosystem.



* **Enhanced user experience:** HOMINIDS focuses on the user experience by offering a user-friendly interface, intuitive features and advanced social interactions. We aim to make the use of blockchain and NFTs easier and more enjoyable for users, driving adoption and engagement.



* **NFT integration:** NFTs have grown in popularity, but it can be difficult for users to find, buy and exchange NFTs seamlessly. HOMINIDS facilitates this integration by offering an integrated NFT marketplace in the metaverse, enabling users to explore, collect and trade unique digital assets with ease.



* **Immersive social interaction:** Metavers offer immense potential for social interaction and collaboration, but many existing projects lack advanced social features. HOMINIDS solves this problem by offering integrated social features, enabling users to connect, collaborate and participate in interactive activities within the virtual universe.

By solving these problems, HOMINIDS aims to democratize access to blockchain and NFT, enhance the user experience and create a dynamic and engaging virtual environment for users worldwide.
