<mark style="color:blue;">**HOMINIDS**</mark> is a groundbreaking project that combines the power of **NFTs**, blockchain and metaverse to create an unparalleled immersive experience. Our goal is to push the boundaries of creativity, social interaction and technological innovation.



We have created a multi-token marketplace with **0% transaction fees**, allowing users to buy, sell and discover a multitude of unique and valuable NFTs. With our Dapp-Marketplace <mark style="color:purple;">era-homi.xyz</mark>, you can access a wide range of hominid NFTs, each representing a unique anthropomorphic character with its own **unique traits, personality and characteristics.**



But HOMINIDS doesn't stop there! We are also developing our own **mobile metaverse using Unreal Engine 5.1.** This metaverse will be connected to our **Dapp-Marketplace**, offering a seamless and immersive experience. You will be able to explore virtual worlds, interact with other users and participate in exciting social and entertainment activities.\


In addition to this, we have **many exciting projects in development**. We are working on the TraitStore, where NFT owners will be able to trade, buy and sell specific traits to customize their NFTs. We also plan to launch a second exclusive collection with advanced features such as wagering and cashback, allowing NFT owners to earn rewards in $HOMI tokens and cashback on transactions made on our platform.\


The security and satisfaction of our community is paramount to us. We are committed to **KYC (Know Your Customer) checks to ensure transparency and security for NFT holders**. In addition, we plan to list our **$HOMI token** on a **CEX and DEX**, which will allow us to reach a wider audience and facilitate trading.
